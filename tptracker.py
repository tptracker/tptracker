#
# HIGHLIGHTS:
#
# 1. The program will be running continuously as it will have to read the
#    changing csv file.
#
# 2. We can check for data after every 10 minutes.
#    I thought of 10 minutes because I assumed that will be the average interval
#    between two dumpers will visiting a specific dumpstation. We may change
#    this value in future
#
# 3. After a check if False is detected in a room, we will want to email the
#    staff.
